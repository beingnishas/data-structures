# data-structures
java programs to learn primitive, complex and advanced data structures

1. Take user input and print on console
2. Take user input and calculate function f(x,y,z) = x4 + y3 + z + (x + y)4z
3. Without using String class methods inputs a non negative integer, separates the integer into its digits and prints them separated by tabs each. For example, if the user types in 42339, the program should print: 4 2 3 3 9
